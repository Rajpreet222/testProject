I decided to create a website called Shop-Top. It is basically an online shopping site on which there are sections of brands are located like real-life outlets. The basic purpose behind this is that people can feel straightforward and realistic while surfing on-site as they are roaming in the mall. With this application, shopping freaks can get the best deals as well as several options to choose from and buy desired  products
